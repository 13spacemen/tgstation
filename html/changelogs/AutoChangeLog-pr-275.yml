changes:
  - code_imp: "Adds default multiplicative movespeed for basic mobs, to make them editable in config"
  - config: "Default multiplicative movespeed for basic mobs in example config"
  - bugfix: "Fixes the speed of all basic mobs."
  - refactor: "Expect to see Killer Tomatoes be a bit smarter as they now are able to juggle multiple targets, lock onto you, and barrel towards you. They're much the same as before, but just a little bit more intelligent, which is especially scary considering they're a fucking plant."
  - refactor: "Lizards (the animal (not the species of people)) are now a bit smarter. Expect to see them avidly hunt down their prey, rather than languish around and wait for it to come to them. Hungry buggers."
  - image: "We now actually implement the previously unused lizard gib animation for those little buggers!"
  - refactor: "Converted butterflies to the basic mob system"
  - rscadd: "Butterflies can now be grown in cytology"
  - code_imp: "Cat Surgeons are a bit more smarter about attacking threats to the world around them on their endless pursuit for those felinid tails."
  - refactor: "Headslugs (the really small slug-like changeling form) are now basic mobs. They only wander around aimlessly now instead of attacking corpses all the time, and examining will let you know what type. Should probably still smash them before they suddenly gain sapience..."
  - refactor: "Giant ants are now more capable of distinguishing friend and foe."
  - code_imp: "Spaceman simple mobs have been converted to basic mobs."
  - refactor: "Mushrooms have been refactors, please report any bugs/unintended behavior"
  - rscadd: "the mushroom basic mob can eat the mushroom plant to heal itself"
  - bugfix: "Carp, Trees, and Festivus Poles will once more sometimes emote at you if they think you are looking at them the wrong way, before they come over to beat you up."
