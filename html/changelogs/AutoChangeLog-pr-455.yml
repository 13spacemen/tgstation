changes:
  - rscadd: "Motho - Bitrunners can now have alternative job titles. FTU urges that these titles are purely cosmetic and not representative of bitrunning ability."
  - rscadd: "Rhials - Two new psyker-oriented virtual domains -- Crate Chaos and Infected Domain."
  - rscadd: "Rhials - Map helper for cyber-police corpse spawn."
  - rscadd: "Rhials - Map helper for swapping the encrypted crate in an area with a random crate from that same area."
  - rscadd: "jlsnow301 - Quantum servers now look for a new machine called a byteforge to spawn loot on- no longer on an invisible landmark. This should make the rooms rebuildable after disasters."
  - rscadd: "jlsnow301 - Most bitrunning machinery is now researchable and buildable via circuits in the engineering protolathe."
  - bugfix: "jlsnow301 - Added extra checks to bitrunning domain cleanup so avatars are deleted properly."
  - bugfix: "Singul0 - Fixes missing baseturfs and clowns in mining planet VDOM."
  - bugfix: "Melbert - Virtual Drink Glasses now look correct."
  - bugfix: "Gboster - Makes the clown mining planet virtual plane actually able to be solved solo."
